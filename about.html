								<p style="font-size:110%; text-align:">Hi! <br>I'm Saad Khan. I grew up in Dubai, UAE, and moved to Virginia in 2015. I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2019 with a Bachelor’s of Science in
									Computer Engineering. Currently, I am working as a Data Analyst at Voya Financial in New York City. I am also an associate at <a href="https://www.dataframe.vc/" target="_blank">DataFrame</a>,
									primarily responsible for investment memos and deal flows.</p>
									<p style="font-size:110%;">My time at the University of Virginia was highlighted by my accomplishments as a student entrepreneur. I went into university hoping to become an electrical
										engineer, focused on solving the most sought-after problem of today: Making energy sustainable. However, after being immersed in the world of data, through classes
										and my student venture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll8-GjCxE3c" target="_blank">(TexMe)</a>, I found myself hooked by the premise of working with data. After changing my major to computer engineering,
										I began my journey exploring the world through the lens of data. Finding meaning where there is none and visualizing that transformation into meaningful insights is why
										I am in awe of Data Science. Being able to "predict", with a certain degree of accuracy, the outcome of a particular event is the excitement and, in my opinion, the pinnacle
										 of technology in the 21st century.</p>
										<p style="font-size:110%;">Two of my favortie quotes that I try to live by everyday: </p>
								<p style="font-style: italic; font-size:110%;">“I am afraid. Not of life, or death, or nothingness, but of wasting it as if I had never been.” - Flowers for Algernon</p>
								<p style="font-style: italic; font-size:110%;">“I might not have the strength or technique of the other players, but I will always be the hardest worker on the pitch.” - Carles Puyol</p>
										<p style="font-style: italic; font-size:110%;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Books I am reading in 2021:</i>
											Steve Jobs, Zero to One, The Data Detective, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, The Big Short, How Innovation Works: And Why It
										Flourishes in Freedom, Inventing the Internet & The Euro Crisis and Its Aftermath.</p>
									<p style="font-style: italic; font-size:110%;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Favorite podcasts:</i>
										Towards Data Science, EconTalk, Mark and Carrie, Conan O'Brian Needs a Friend, HBR IdeaCast.</p>
